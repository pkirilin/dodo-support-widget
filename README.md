# dodo-support-widget

Custom support widget for searching helpful articles in internal knowledge base service.

There was a personal challenge to make it from scratch on vanilla JavaScript without any UI libraries in one day.

## Launch backend

Create .env file with knowledge base service api key: `API_KEY=<api key>`

```shell
cd backend
npm ci
npm start
```

## Launch frontend

```shell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm start
```
